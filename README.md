This repository was created with the idea that one problem can be solved is many many ways. 

The idea is to prove that what people call of "Programming Logic" is unreasonable and pretty incorrect. 

Usually, at CS courses, people learn that 'when you learn the logic, you know all languages'. This is not a correct sentence. Normally, you will learn structured logic, fake OO patterns and will be able to (mis)use the mainstream languages such as Java, C#, PHP, Golang, and so on, and so forth. 

You will always have new things to learn. New paradigms, new ways to think of problems. 

I intend to add new languages as I think of them.

This repo will also be used to present features from differente programming languages (such as Object Capabilities, Dependant Types, Refined Types, etc).

Hope you enjoy :)

Every folder will have the code for a specific language and will also contain a README pointing to a place to go if you want to dig deeper on that lang.
