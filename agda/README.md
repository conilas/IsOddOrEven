I recommend setting up the environment with agda + emacs so you can have the full experience with this language.

This program will check the correcteness of a program based on is even or is odd rules. 

Agda is, per se, a dependently typed programming language where you can prove theorems. It is kinda different from, say, LiquidHaskell because the development of the program and the correcteness proof are the same activity located in the language itself. It will not require an external SMT solver.
